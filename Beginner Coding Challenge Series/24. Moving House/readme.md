<h1 align='center'>~ Moving House ~</h1>

<p>I'd like to calculate how long on average I've lived in a single house. Given a person's age and the number of times they've moved house as moves, return the average number of years that they've spent living in the same house.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

```
yearsInOneHouse(30, 1) ➞ 15
yearsInOneHouse(15, 2) ➞ 5
yearsInOneHouse(80, 0) ➞ 80
```

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You can assume that the tests include people who've always lived in a house.</li>
