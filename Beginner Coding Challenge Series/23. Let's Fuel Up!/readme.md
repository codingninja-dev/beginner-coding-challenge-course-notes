<h1 align='center'>~ Let's Fuel Up! ~</h1>

<p>A vehicle needs 10 times the amount of fuel than the distance it travels. However, it must always carry a minimum of 100 fuel before setting off. Create a function which calculates the amount of fuel it needs, given the distance.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

```
calculateFuel(15) ➞ 150
calculateFuel(23.5) ➞ 235
calculateFuel(3) ➞ 100
```

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Distance will be a number greater than zero.</li>
  <li>Return 100 if the calculated fuel turns out to be less than 100.</li>
